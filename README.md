## Compiler Course Project
This project represents a simulation of conversion from non deterministic finite state automata to deterministic finite state automata then to check regular expressions whether it valid or not.

Using java and javafx to simulate the algorithm of conversion froM NDFSA  given from input to DFSA using tabular method to view each step changes of the algorithm.
